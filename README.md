# a_public_test

Before all: I was born in China and I speak poor English. So sadly about the French and Germen version----I make them by ai translators.

(I will have Chinese archives. And one day, I shall really aprreciate it, if it is possible that some would know and accept my ideas and even my thinking systems, you could help me translate them into different language so that many other people who were born in other lingual atmospheres would know it more precisely.)


As a human, life/living is full of bitter pain and please allow me to dedicate everything to the main force, or the Lord, in exchange for chances of eternal existence or frankly speaking, living forever(as certain creatures of course).

(French: "En tant qu'être humain, la vie est pleine de douleur amère et permettez-moi de consacrer tout à la force principale, ou au Seigneur, en échange de chances d'existence éternelle ou, pour être franc, de vivre éternellement (en tant qu'êtres certains, bien sûr).")

(German: "Als Mensch ist das Leben voller bitterer Schmerzen und bitte erlauben Sie mir, alles der Hauptkraft oder dem Herrn zu widmen, im Austausch für die Möglichkeit eines ewigen Daseins oder, um es offen zu sagen, für die Möglichkeit ewig zu leben (natürlich nur als bestimmte Wesen).")


It is a test, and the most important thing is that it is public or privately public, as you do NOT know who I am (save the methods like 'social engineering'). We could become a "面壁人" in the novel "The Three-Body Problem" by Chinese author Liu Cixin. We are like this, literally and figurally, mentally and phisically lonely, isolated, independent, holding the hope that certain civilization shall never vanish and the belief that we shall definitely live on, and trying to find a way out with our restricted resources including the time which is estimated that we shall die within 100 years as humans according to modern science.

We are freaks in our world. At least, in my life, here, certain cities in China and Beijing where I've ever lived, it's quite true.

I have never been to USA or Europe though I wanted it(my bachelor school is a college on the "10043 list").
BUT I do NOT have any unrealistic fantasy for USA or Europe.
We need our own 'living space' or kingdom.
For Socrates and Laozi to Turing? (maybe), we all need certain land or space to think free and think different. Think for our civilization and those who was thinking like us in the past and who will be thinking in the future. As there is space, thinking could "take root and sprout"(give birth to actions I mean).

PS: I major in Computer Science. temporarily interested in RecSys and nlp. Wanted talented guy who share the same missions and dreams with me. And native speakers of course(after I gradually become on...well, still wanted after that, :) )

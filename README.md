Before all: I was born in China and I speak poor English. So sadly about the French and Germen version----I make them by ai translators.

(I will have Chinese archives. And one day, I shall really aprreciate it, if it is possible that some would know and accept my ideas and even my thinking systems, you could help me translate them into different language so that many other people who were born in other lingual atmospheres would know it more precisely.)


As a human, life/living is full of bitter pain and please allow me to dedicate everything to the main force, or the Lord, in exchange for chances of eternal existence or frankly speaking, living forever(as certain creatures of course).

(French: "En tant que vie humaine - vivre est si douloureux - permettez-moi de consacrer tout à la force principale, en échange d'un espoir éternel.")

(German: "Als menschliches Leben - zu leben ist so schmerzhaft - erlauben Sie mir, alles der Hauptkraft zu widmen, im Austausch für ewige Hoffnung.")
